# Project Title: Search Anime

## Introduction
The "Search Anime" project is a web application built with React and Vite that allows users to search for their favorite anime titles. The application aims to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface to discover information about various anime series.

## Project Overview
The main features of the "Search Anime" application include:
- Anime Search: Users can easily search for anime titles by entering keywords in the search bar.
- Anime Details: Upon selecting a specific anime from the search results, users can view detailed information about that anime.
- Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive and accessible across different devices.

## Purpose of the Project
The primary purpose of the "Search Anime" project is to serve as a learning exercise for various technologies and concepts. The project aims to achieve the following learning objectives:

1. React: Gain hands-on experience with React, one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building user interfaces. By building the "Search Anime" application, developers will learn how to create reusable components, manage component state, handle events, and implement smooth user interactions using React.

2. Vite: Explore the Vite build tool and understand how it streamlines the development process. Vite offers rapid development, hot module replacement, and fast building, which enables developers to focus on code and see instant changes during development.

3. useState Hook: Understand the useState hook in React, which allows developers to add state to functional components. The "Search Anime" application will demonstrate how to manage and update state within the context of a React functional component.

4. API Integration: Learn how to integrate external APIs into a web application. In this project, the Rapid API is used to fetch anime data, introducing developers to the process of making API requests and handling API responses.

## Technologies Used
The project utilizes the following technologies:
- **React:** A powerful JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.
- **Vite:** A fast and lightweight build tool that enables quick development and server-side rendering.
- **Rapid API:** An API marketplace used to fetch anime data and integrate it into the application.

## How to Use Rapid API
The "Search Anime" application utilizes the Rapid API to fetch anime data and integrate it into the application. To use the Rapid API in this project, follow these steps:

1. **Sign Up:** If you don't have a Rapid API account, visit the [Rapid API website](https://rapidapi.com/) and sign up for a free account.

2. **Subscribe to the Anime Data API:** After signing in, navigate to the [Anime Data API](https://rapidapi.com/brian.rofiq/api/anime-db/) and subscribe to the API. This will provide you with an API key that you'll use to make requests.

3. **Copy Your API Key:** Once you have subscribed to the Anime Data API, you'll receive an API key. Copy this API key as you'll need to use it in the application to access anime data.

4. **Replace the API Key in the Application:** Open the `api.js` file in your project, where the API calls are made. Look for the following line:
   ```jsx
   "x-rapidapi-key": "YOUR_RAPID_API_KEY",
   ```

## Installation
To run the "Search Anime" application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Install the required dependencies using npm by running the following command:

```
npm install
```

## Challenges Faced
- During the development of the "Search Anime" project, several challenges were encountered. Some notable ones include:

- Learning how to interact with external APIs and making API calls securely.
Handling asynchronous operations and managing state updates based on API responses.

## Future Improvements
The "Search Anime" application has a lot of potential for further enhancements. Some possible future improvements include:

- Adding caching mechanisms to reduce the number of API requests and improve application performance.
- Implementing error handling and user feedback when anime data is not available or API requests fail.
- Providing an option to view trailers or related media for the selected anime titles.

## Conclusion
The "Search Anime" project successfully demonstrates how React and Vite can be used to build a dynamic and responsive anime search application. The integration of Rapid API adds real anime data, enriching the user experience by providing access to a vast collection of anime titles. The project remains open-source, and we welcome contributions from the community to make it even better.
